## user experience

Upon loading the page the user will see  the current date and time as well as timeblocks
of every hour from 9am to 5pm. The textarea for each time block will display a color
either red, blue, or green; which denotes past, present, or future respectively. Each timeblock also features a save button that allows the user to save the text in the text area to local storage.
